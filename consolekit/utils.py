	Compare two sequences of lines; generate the delta as a unified diff.

	Unified diffs are a compact way of showing line changes and a few
	lines of context. The number of context lines is set by ``n`` which
	defaults to three.

	By default, the diff control lines (those with ``---``, ``+++``, or ``@@``)
	are created with a trailing newline. This is helpful so that inputs
	created from ``file.readlines()`` result in diffs that are suitable for
	``file.writelines()`` since both the inputs and outputs have trailing
	newlines.

	For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm
	argument to ``''`` so that the output will be uniformly newline free.

	The unidiff format normally has a header for filenames and modification
	times. Any or all of these may be specified using strings for
	``fromfile``, ``tofile``, ``fromfiledate``, and ``tofiledate``.
	The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format.

	**Example:**

	>>> for line in coloured_diff('one two three four'.split(),
	...             'zero one tree four'.split(), 'Original', 'Current',
	...             '2005-01-26 23:30:50', '2010-04-02 10:20:52',
	...             lineterm=''):
